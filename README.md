Hey there! Thank you for passing by, in this README I'll explain everything you need to know about strapi, how to dump and restore the database, so please, have a coffe and read calmly :) 

# Getting started :zap:

## With cloning :busts_in_silhouette:

Let's start with cloning this repository 

### Prerequisites :wrench:
 For the strapi version I used to build this project, you need to have this versions:

| Strapi | Node | npm|
| ------ | ------ |  ------|
|     v3.1.0-alpha.5   |     v14.x.x   |  v6.x.x|

If you use yarn, every version is good!

### Cloning :busts_in_silhouette:
On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. Above the list of files, click Code.

![alt text](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-20363/images/help/repository/code-button.png)

Copy the URL for the repository, open Git Bash. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

```
$cd desktop

```
Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/LudmiDev/cms.git

```
Press Enter to create your local clone.

```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/LudmiDev/cms.git
> Cloning into `desktop`...

> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
Then, put npm install, to install all the dependencies

```
npm install 
# or 
yarn add 
```
Then, put npm run develop to watch the project in your localhost

```
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```
Yay :tada: you're now in strapi locally!

Put /admin in the link or the localhost, and log in or register ;)

Congratulations! You're in the main page!

You can browse freely the content manager section, and the content type builder. You can even create your own schema and watch the changes on the database!

# Getting started with the Database :card_file_box:
This part is not easy, but I'll do my best to help you.
First of all, you need to install **PostgreSQL**, [this link](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) will take you to the download page.

Also you need to install **pgAdmin 4**, here's the [download link](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

Nice job! You're alredy made half the labor!

## pgAdmin 4 :construction_worker:
Open up pgAdmin, and make a new server

![pgAdminphoto](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674662340/Captura_ltvivq.png)

In the name of the server, you can put whatever you want, be creative! But on these fields, you need to put this information.
The data is listed here:

- host: containers-us-west-28.railway.app
- password: SRhMFswwMYAyArEIRjBE
- port: 5639


![pgAdminServer](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674663720/asasas_yj36e2.png)

There you go! You have now access to the database, you can browse the tables freely :)

![pgAdminDB](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674663834/pasoaps_xsyzt5.png)

# How to backup the database? :thinking_face:

In order to make a backup of the database, first we need to make a **dump**. 
What is a dump? Is an output of data that can help us to back up the database. 
Well, there's a lot of ways to make a dump, so I'll list two of them

## Dump with pgAdmin :passport_control:
We open yet again pgAdmin, search the database we desire, click Backup.

![backup](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674681498/backupdump_v72xxg.png)

You can choose any specifications you want

![specidi](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674681613/cooldump_vzxaco.png)

Wait a little bit, and done!

![done](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674681788/nice_doneaa_frxhhv.png)

This is a very convenient way if you want to do it with pgAdmin, because if you dump the database with CMD It will be kinda hard to restore it with pgAdmin.

This way, it's only two clicks!

![donao](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674682190/recirt_df1yzi.png)

![data](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674682122/restoring_wslu8v.png)

Wait a little bit, and yey! You have your data!

# With CMS :computer:

So let's get hands on this!
I'm gonna assume you're a windows user, so first of all, we got to execute CMD as administrator

If you're a Linux user check out this [link](https://linuxhint.com/pg-dump-postgresql/), It will help you

![cmd](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674233752/open-cmd-with-admin-rights_bgmvqy.png)

Then, you need to travel by cd to the bin folder of the PostgreSQL folder, like this!


![cmdtravel](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674233892/assaasassa_hfacme.png)

You can copy the code to make this proccess easier


```
cd ..

cd ..

cd "Program Files"

cd PostgreSQL

cd 15

cd bin
```
Well done! Now we need to write this command: 

```
pg_dump -U postgres -W -h containers-us-west-28.railway.app -p 5639 railway > <name of the dump :) >.sql

```
And then, is gonna ask you the password, if you forgot it, there you have it ;)
```
SRhMFswwMYAyArEIRjBE

```

If you travel to 
```C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin```
you'll notice that the dump was successfully created.

![pros](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674234433/assasssss_jl2djn.png)

Well done! You made your dump :D

# Making a backup database with the dump data :hammer:

Ok with this dump we made, we can finally back up our database into another one.
First, we open pgAdmin 4 again, and we'll create a database.

![database](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674663984/asasassdffgg_ufe3dv.png)

Put it a cool name, and then, we'll move on to CMD

We'll open CMD as admin again, and browse to get to ```C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\15\bin```
and put this command

```
psql -h containers-us-west-28.railway.app -p 5639 -U postgres -f <nameOfDump>.sql <name-of-database-you-just-created>
```
Wait a little bit, and :

![pgadmindb](https://res.cloudinary.com/dweiaqd6l/image/upload/v1674235017/nice_done_gw0vqh.png)

Well done! You successfully restored data from the dump, and made a cool backup! :D
